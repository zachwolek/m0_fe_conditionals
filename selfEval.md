# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- Fairly confident, I need to practice "===" instead of "=" to define conditionals

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- Very Confident, expressing all conditionals must be met (or at least one of them must be met) seems self explanatory

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- Very, I took several deductive reasoning courses in college and this is more or less p > q logic involving executed code. The "else if"s are fun. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- It took four Pomodoro timers of 25 minutes, which is about the amount of time I wanted to spend on Section 1 of 5 two days before deadline. 


1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
-  Overall I felt pretty confident with conditionals. Most of my questions however came with formatting git workflow. I don't necessarily know if this is a calendar issue than trial and error. 

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I have more questions such as learning more potential, like the "% === 0" function that lets you test the identity of the remainder after division

To the instructors grading this: As I keep having all of these questions I feel like I don't have a place to organize them and I end up forgetting them. I'm not really quite sure how to organize "To do"s on questions just yet
